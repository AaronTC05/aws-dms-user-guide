# Sources for Data Migration<a name="CHAP_Source"></a>

AWS Database Migration Service \(AWS DMS\) can use many of the most popular databases as a source for data replication\. The database source can be on anÂ Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instance, an Amazon Relational Database Service \(Amazon RDS\) instance, or an on\-premises database\. In addition, you can use S3 as a source\.

Valid sources for AWS DMS include the following:

**On\-premises and Amazon EC2 instance databases**

+ Oracle versions 10\.2 and later, 11g, and up to 12\.1, for the Enterprise, Standard, Standard One, and Standard Two editions

+ Microsoft SQL Server versions 2005, 2008, 2008R2, 2012, 2014, and 2016, for the Enterprise, Standard, Workgroup, and Developer editions\. The Web and Express editions are not supported\.
